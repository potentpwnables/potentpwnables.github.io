# The Name

Tibbles 'N Bits is a bit of a play on words, spoofing on the dog food Kibbles 'N Bits. [Tibbles](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tibbles.html) are modified data frames, and the terminology was introduced with the advent of the "tidyverse" in R, which is one of the primary languages I use in my analyses. Bits are, of course, ones and zeroes. The point of making a pun out of Kibbles 'N Bits is related to the notion of "dogfooding", and while I won't necessarily be building tools/products for users that I use myself, I will be using tools and best practices for things like conducting DFIR investigations and automating analyses in my own side projects, which is at least akin to the spirit of dogfooding.

# The Content

The content will be an attempt at sharing both what I'm learning and how I'm learning it. This means writing up my solutions to CTFs, working through examples I see in books and blog posts, and anything I choose to do in my home lab. The posts will focus on topics like Windows & Linux forensics, reverse engineering, OSINT challenges, data analysis, report generation, and automation. 

Each post will walk through what I'm trying to learn or do, and will be written mostly in a stream of consciousness kind of style. What this means is that the posts will focus more on showing people the various struggles and troubleshooting steps I go through as I learn, as opposed to trying to provide a clear, concise set of steps on a topic. My hope is that this gives people more confidence to dive into this stuff on their own as they see that other people struggle with it as well.

Be warned: I'm not a great writer, and not very good at sticking to a schedule, so don't get your hopes up about consistent, quality content. But with any luck, you'll at least find it interesting.
