# The Author

I'm just your typical nerd that likes computers and data. I'm self taught in programming and cyber security, and have learned pretty much all I know from work experience, toying around at home, and watching YouTube videos. I like automating processes, conducting data analytics in service of investigations, and working with various programming languages. I have investigated money laundering, terrorist financing, and disinformation campaigns; worked as a SOC analyst; and built tools that help parse large amounts of data to draw out insights. My interests are a cross-section of investigations, malware analysis, threat hunting, and data engineering. And the content of this blog will likely reflect that.

# The Name

Tibbles 'N Bits is a bit of a play on words, spoofing on the dog food Kibbles 'N Bits. [Tibbles](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tibbles.html) are modified data frames, and the terminology was introduced with the advent of the "tidyverse" in R, which is the first language I learned, and a language I still use heavily today. Bits are, of course, ones and zeroes. But ultimately, I just like puns. 

# The Content

The content will be an attempt at sharing both what I'm learning and how I'm learning it. This means writing up my solutions to CTFs, working through examples I see in books and blog posts, and anything I choose to do in my home lab. The posts will focus on topics like Windows & Linux forensics, reverse engineering, OSINT challenges, data analysis, data engineering, report generation, and automation. 

Each post will walk through what I'm trying to learn or do, and will be written mostly in a stream of consciousness kind of style. What this means is that the posts will focus more on showing people the various struggles and troubleshooting steps I go through as I learn, as opposed to trying to provide a clear, concise set of steps on a topic. My hope is that this gives people more confidence to dive into this stuff on their own as they see that other people struggle with it as well.

Be warned: I'm not a great writer, and not very good at sticking to a schedule, so don't get your hopes up about consistent, quality content. But with any luck, you'll at least find it interesting.
