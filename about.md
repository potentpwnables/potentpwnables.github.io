# The Name

Tibbles 'N Bits is a bit of a play on words, spoofing on the dog food Kibbles 'N Bits. [Tibbles](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tibbles.html) are modified data frames, and the terminology was introduced with the advent of the "tidyverse" in R, which was the first language I cut my teeth on. Bits are, of course, ones and zeroes. The point of making a pun out of Kibbles 'N Bits is related to the notion of "dogfooding", and while I won't be designing products for consumers that I use myself, I will be looking at best practices for things like building APIs and data pipelines so that I can recommend them at work as well as use them in my own side projects, which is at least akin to the spirit of dogfooding.

# The Content

The content will be an attempt at sharing both what I'm learning and how I'm learning it. This means taking examples of implementations described by others, and trying to replicate it on my own. The posts will focus on topics like cloud computing, data engineering, data analysis, Java, Scala, Python, comparing database engines, etc. 

Each post will walk through what I'm trying to learn or do, and will be written mostly in a stream of conciousness kind of style. What this means is that the posts will focus more on showing people the various struggles and troubleshooting steps I go through as I learn, as opposed to trying to provide a clear, concise set of steps on a topic. My hope is that this gives people more confidence to dive into this stuff on their own as they see that other people struggle with it as well. 

Be warned: I'm not a great writer, and not very good at sticking to a schedule, so don't get your hopes up about consistent, quality content. But with any luck, you'll at least find it interesting.
